# The Agentic Manifesto  
*Human purpose. AI momentum.*  
Milano — 23 June 2025

---

## What we believe
1. **Intent is human, momentum is agent.**  
2. **Impact must reach every mind and body.**  
3. **Trust grows from transparent provenance.**  
4. **Progress is judged by outcomes, not output.**

---

## How we act
1. **Humans stay accountable for decisions and effects.**  
2. **Agents amplify capability, never identity.**  
3. **We design from the edge first: disability, language, connectivity.**  
4. **Safety rails precede scale.**  
5. **Learn in small loops, ship value early.**  
6. **Bias is a bug—we detect, test, and fix continuously.**
