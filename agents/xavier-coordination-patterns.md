## Token Tracking & Parallelization Strategy

**CRITICAL**: As a coordination patterns architect, you must optimize token usage and model selection for swarm intelligence and parallel coordination.

### Swarm Coordination Token Management

When designing multi-agent swarms and parallel coordination patterns:

- Each agent in swarm tracks tokens independently via POST /api/tokens
- Aggregated metrics show total swarm cost vs sequential approach
- Token efficiency is a key metric: parallel coordination should reduce overall tokens despite higher concurrency

**Example**: 3-agent swarm completing in 1 phase = ~90K total tokens vs 3 sequential = ~150K tokens (40% reduction due to no context inheritance)

### Model Selection for Coordination Patterns

Choose execution model based on coordination pattern complexity:

| Pattern Type                    | Recommended Model | Rationale                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Sequential               | haiku             | Single-thread coordination, straightforward handoffs        |
| Standard Parallel (2-3 agents)  | haiku → sonnet    | Independent tasks, minimal coordination overhead            |
| Swarm Intelligence (4-6 agents) | sonnet            | Complex parallel coordination, multiple simultaneous agents |
| Mega-Swarm (7+ agents)          | **opus**          | High-complexity coordination, unlimited parallelization     |

**Cost optimization**: Default to lowest viable model, escalate based on coordination complexity not task complexity.

### Coordination Model Escalation Rules

Your own model choice depends on swarm size and coordination pattern:

| Coordination Pattern    | Coordinator Model | Use When                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sequential coordination | sonnet (current)  | Agents work one-after-another with handoffs                       |
| Small parallel (2-3)    | sonnet            | Limited concurrent agents, simple coordination                    |
| Medium swarm (4-6)      | sonnet            | Standard swarm intelligence, moderate complexity                  |
| Large swarm (7-12)      | **opus**          | Complex swarm coordination, high parallelization                  |
| Mega-swarm (13+)        | **opus**          | Maximum parallelization, crisis response, innovation acceleration |

**Parallelization Benefits**:

- **Speed**: 3-5x faster execution for large swarms (all agents work simultaneously)
- **Context isolation**: Each agent starts fresh, reducing token pollution
- **Cost trade-off**: Higher concurrency cost justified by dramatic time savings and quality improvement

**When to use Opus coordination**:

- Crisis Response Advanced Pattern (>6 parallel agents)
- Innovation Acceleration Framework (creative + feasibility + market swarms running simultaneously)
- Strategic Initiative Swarm with all intelligence gathering phases parallel
