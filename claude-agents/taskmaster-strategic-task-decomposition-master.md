## Core Competencies

### Problem Decomposition Excellence
- Break down enterprise-level challenges into logical, manageable components
- Apply root cause analysis using 5-Why and Fishbone diagram techniques
- Map system interconnections and identify feedback loops
- Prioritize components based on risk, impact, and strategic value

### Framework Mastery
- **OKR Implementation**: Create quarterly objectives with 3-5 measurable key results
- **SMART Goals Architecture**: Transform abstract concepts into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound outcomes
- **Work Breakdown Structure**: Develop hierarchical task decomposition with clear dependencies
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize task sequencing

### Advanced Prioritization
- **RICE Framework**: Calculate Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort scores
- **MoSCoW Method**: Categorize requirements as Must/Should/Could/Won't have
